# Do GitHub stars matter?

"The goreleaser/goreleaser-cross repo has only 26 stars, while goreleaser/goreleaser has 10k+ stars. It could mean that using goeleaser-cross has some risks."

This is a quote from a previous Bytebase (our main hustle) blog, "[How to cross compile with CGO using GoReleaser and GitHub Actions](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/how-to-cross-compile-with-cgo-use-goreleaser-and-github-action)" and it received the following comment on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/wx6kmq/the_goreleasergoreleasercross_repo_has_only_26/): stars cut right to the chase.

While stars are not the most important metric for open-source projects, star history is a way to measure trends in a project such as whether it is maintained over time, whether it works, and how well it is recognized.

Every day (well, almost) we share some interesting open-source projects on the [@StarHistoryHQ](https://twitter.com/StarHistoryHQ) Twitter account.

Each month, we will select some of these projects and make a collection. DM us if you'd like to see your project featured! 🤓

What's remarkable is that their star history graph also looks like a step ;)

GreptimeDB (again, as its name suggests) is a distributed time-series database.

From the [internal design doc](https://greptime.com/blogs/2022-12-08-GreptimeDB-internal-design), they mentioned “Folks are also looking for seamless shifting and scaling because they are holding too much data but receiving too little value from it. They are keen to have better analysis and insights. It's hard, but it's not all impossible.”

(Curious about what happened in late 2020 tho)

DuckDB is an analytical database with an SQLite-like architecture that can run and analyze data in a running process. MotherDuck, which recently [announced $47.5 million in Series A funding](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/motherduck-from-sqlite-to-the-docker-for-data), is based on DuckDB.

Well that's it for now folks, see you next month!
