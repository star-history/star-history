[React](https://react.dev/) entering the **Linux Foundation** this year marks a new chapter for one of the world’s most influential open-source projects. Governance is opening, the ecosystem is expanding, and developers are rallying around tools that push React toward a faster, more modular future.

This month, we highlight four standout React projects shaping how teams build interfaces, data flows, dashboards, and developer tooling:

|                    |                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **React Scan**     | Real-time performance profiler for React |
| **xyflow**         | Visual graph/diagram engine for React    |
| **TanStack Query** | Server-state management for React apps   |
| **refine**         | Full-stack React framework for CRUD apps |

## [React Scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan)

#### → Real-Time React Performance Insights

React Scan is an innovative runtime profiler that overlays component rendering behavior directly in your UI. With a single import, developers can see precisely which components re-render — and why.

- **Strengths**: Instant feedback, zero-config setup, powerful for production debugging.
- **Limitations**: Early-stage project; API and features evolve quickly.

👉 React Scan represents the new wave of *DX-first React tooling*, helping teams catch performance regressions before they ship.

## [xyflow](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow)

#### → Building Node-Based Editors & Graph Interfaces

Xyflow is the engine behind some of today’s most polished workflow editors — including Cloudflare Workers’ visual editor. From node-based diagrams to no-code builders, it provides a flexible canvas for interactive graph-based UIs.

- **Strengths**: Production-ready, highly customizable, large ecosystem.
- **Limitations**: Complex use cases may require learning its layout/custom node APIs.

👉 xyflow shows how far React can stretch — powering the next generation of low-code tools, editors, and data visualizations.

## [TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query)

#### → Server-State Management Done Right

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=TanStack/query\&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#TanStack/query&Date)

TanStack Query (formerly React Query) remains one of the most essential libraries in modern React apps. It simplifies fetching, caching, mutations, retries, pagination — everything related to "server state".

- **Strengths**: Predictable async flows, strong TypeScript model, works across frameworks.
- **Limitations**: Not intended for client state; pairs best with Zustand/Jotai/Redux.

👉 A stable, battle-tested cornerstone of enterprise React, TanStack Query continues to grow steadily as apps become more data-heavy.

## [refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)

#### → Full-Stack React Framework for Internal Tools

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=refinedev/refine\&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#refinedev/refine&Date)

Refine is a full-stack React framework designed for building dashboards, admin panels, and CRUD-heavy apps. It integrates cleanly with UI kits (Ant Design, Mui, Chakra), authentication providers, and backend services from Supabase to NestJS.

- **Strengths**: Strong conventions, extensible providers, accelerates CRUD development.
- **Limitations**: Best suited for internal tools; not a general-purpose app framework.

👉 Refine brings a Rails-like productivity layer to React — ideal for teams that need fast, maintainable tools.
