AI agents are no longer just prototypes - they’re becoming the backbone of production systems. Developers are building **structured, autonomous software** that reasons, uses tools, and collaborates with users - powered by a fast-growing ecosystem of SDKs and frameworks.

This month, we highlight four standout projects shaping how intelligent applications are built and deployed:

| |  |
|---|---|
| **Assistant UI**      | Chat-native UI toolkit for agent interfaces                  |
| **Mastra**            | Full-stack TypeScript agent framework                        |
| **Claude Agent SDKs** | Official multi-language SDKs for building agents with Claude |
| **VitePlus**          | Next-generation JavaScript toolchain for modern web apps     |

Assistant UI is an open-source toolkit for creating chat-style interfaces. It provides React components and APIs to embed conversational agents directly into your product - with modern design, beautiful defaults, and full TypeScript support.

* **Strengths**: Polished UI components, flexible integration, and built on shadcn/ui + Tailwind.
* **Limitations**: Primarily web-focused; native and mobile support are evolving.

👉 Assistant UI gives your agents a front-end identity - transforming LLM logic into elegant, human-centered experiences.

## [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/)

#### → Full-Stack TypeScript Agent Framework

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=mastra-ai/mastra\&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#mastra-ai/mastra&Date)

Mastra is a rapidly maturing, full-stack framework for building AI agents with TypeScript. It unifies model orchestration, retrieval workflows, and observability - enabling developers to ship scalable, production-grade AI systems.

* **Strengths**: Type-safe, modular, integrates with 40+ model providers; strong tooling and documentation.
* **Limitations**: APIs evolve quickly as the framework expands.

👉 Mastra brings engineering rigor to AI development - making agents testable, composable, and ready for real-world use.

## [Claude Agent SDKs](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python)

#### → Building Agents with Claude

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python\&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python&Date)

Anthropic’s **Claude Agent SDKs**, available for multiple languages, including [Python](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk/python) and [TypeScript](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk/typescript), provide structured abstractions for building Claude-powered agents. They include components for tool use, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and persistent multi-step workflows - enabling developers to design reliable, autonomous systems.

* **Strengths**: First-party SDKs from Anthropic, unified across languages, aligned with Claude’s safety and reasoning architecture.
* **Limitations**: Memory persistence and orchestration layers are still maturing.

👉 The Claude Agent SDKs elevate agent development to a first-class discipline - offering developers a safe, composable foundation for building intelligent systems.

## [VitePlus](https://viteplus.dev/)

#### → Next-Generation JavaScript Toolchain

*(Note: VitePlus is in active development by VoidZero, the team behind Vite, with a public preview expected in early 2026.)*

VitePlus isn’t an AI framework - it’s the evolution of Vite into a **unified JavaScript toolchain**. It adds commands for building, testing, linting, formatting, and managing monorepos, all powered by Rust-based tools like Rolldown and Oxlint for near-instant feedback.

* **Strengths**: Unified developer experience, high-speed incremental builds, strong TypeScript support.
* **Limitations**: Still in private development; not yet generally available.

👉 As AI-powered agents merge into everyday web apps, VitePlus provides the performance foundation and developer experience to ship them efficiently.
