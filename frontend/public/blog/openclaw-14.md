OpenClaw has officially crossed a milestone: with **224K+ stars**, it has surpassed the Linux kernel (218K) to become the **14th most-starred repository on GitHub** — the fastest star growth in GitHub history. Among non-aggregator software projects, OpenClaw now trails only **React** (243K) — and at this rate, it might not hold that lead for long.
