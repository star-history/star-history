The Star History team posts new open source projects daily on [@StarHistoryHQ](https://twitter.com/StarHistoryHQ). The team also curates [a monthly newsletter](/blog/star-history-monthly-pick-202305) to list intriguing open source projects.

The Star History content is consumed by thousands of visitors every month. Among the visitors, the open
source practitioners and the open source investors are the two largest groups.

To better connecting the open source project maintainers with the Star History Audience, we are piloting a new program called **Starlet List** to accept open source project nomination. Once accepted, we will list it on Star History website for an extended period of time.

This program is totally free during the pilot period. Just shoot us an email at [star@bytebase.com](mailto:star@bytebase.com) and tell us how your open source project wants to be presented to the audience.
